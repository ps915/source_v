# About SOURCE V
## The idea
The SOURCE V is a continuation of the SOURCE frame line initiated by Team BlackSheep. It seeks to perfect the vertical, ultra-stiff and low drag racing frame for drone racers.

The frame is donated to the community to empower creators and makers, and integrate best practices and current trends faster into a continuously manufactured product. In return, it allows the local distribution network to have cheap and direct access to a good frame to compete in an increasingly competitive marketplace.

## Project naming requirements
SOURCE V is the name of the frame. If you are thinking about manufacturing it, you are expected to prefix the name with a brand name in order to allow customers to distinguish the different manufacturers, e.g. “TBS SOURCE V”. As a manufacturer you are also expected to denote the version number of the frame files that you have placed as basis of the project, e.g. “TBS SOURCE V V1”. 
If you have forked the project, you need to give it another name in order to avoid confusion between SOURCE V and your project.
Accessories from the SOURCE V project also need to be named with the entire prefix, e.g. “TBS SOURCE V FPV Camera Adapter”. Unless the file is not compatible with certain versions of the frame, the compatible version number or version range also needs to be included in the name, e.g. “TBS SOURCE V FPV Camera Adapter V1 - V2”
